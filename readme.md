# Safe (-) - Safe Dash

## Problem
Many drivers of older, budget cars lack access to advanced safety features like drowsiness detection and collision warning systems. This can lead to dangerous driving conditions and increase the risk of accidents.

To illustrate, in 2024, more than 25% of all cars in the U.S. are at least 17 years old. Another study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that older cars are involved in more accidents on average, with a higher percentage of those accidents being fatal.

## Solution
Introducing **Safe Dash**â€”an affordable, easy-to-install safety system that detects driver drowsiness and warns of potential collisions. Powered by AI and simple cameras, Safe Dash offers real-time alerts to keep drivers awake and aware on the road, without the need for expensive smart cars.
